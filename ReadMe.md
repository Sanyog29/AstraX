   - **Insert Mode** â€“ Edit code smoothly.  
   - **Command Mode** â€“ Run, compile, rename, and delete files.  
âœ… **Built-in Code Execution** â€“ Uses **fork + exec** to compile and run C++ directly.  
âœ… **Inline Error Display** â€“ Compiler errors appear inside the editor.  
âœ… **File Management** â€“ Create, rename, and delete files **without leaving Astra**.  

### **ðŸ”§ How to Use**  
1. **Open Astra** â†’ `./astra`
